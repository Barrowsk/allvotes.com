            <p class="state-p">Missouri requires a photo or non-photo ID to vote a regular ballot in person. Acceptable
                IDs are:</p>
            <ul class="list-2">
                <li>Option 1: Non-expired Missouri driver license; Non-expired or non-expiring Missouri non-driver
                    license; Non-expired document which contains the voter's name and photograph and is issued by the
                    United States or the state of Missouri; or Non-expired or non-expiring military ID card which
                    contains a photograph</li>

                    election authority of the state; Identification issued by the United States government or agency
                    thereof; Identification issued by an institution of higher education, including a university,
                    college, vocational and technical school, located within the state of Missouri; or A copy of a

            </ul>
            <p class="state-p">Voters who possess an ID under Option 2 must also sign a sworn statement. A voter who
                does not have an Option 1 ID and refuses to execute a sworn statement can vote a provisional ballot.
                Under these circumstances, a provisional ballot will be counted if the voter returns to the polling
                place and shows a valid Option 1 ID or if the signature on the provisional ballot envelope matches the
                signature on the voter’s registration record.<br><br>You will need to submit a copy of your voter ID
                with your absentee ballot request form if you registered to vote by mail, this is your first time
                voting, and you did not include a copy of ID with your registration application.</p>
