                    Office’s website</a> for information about applying to vote by mail.<br><br>The deadline to request
                a mail-in ballot will be 5 p.m. on the Tuesday before Election Day. Voted ballots must be received by 8
                p.m. on Election Day. They can be returned by mail or in person at your County Election
                Office.<br><br>The state will continue to offer absentee voting alongside mail-in voting. You may only
                vote absentee if you have one of the following reasons:</p>
            <ul class="list-2">
                <li>You will be absent from your municipality of residence during the entire period the polls are open
                    due to your occupation or business (Students who are attending school in another state can use this
                    reason if they still consider themselves residents of Pennsylvania)</li>
                <li>You are in the military</li>
                <li>You are a spouse or dependent of a person in the military and expect to be absent from your

                <li>You are a county employee who expects your Election Day duties relating to the conduct of the
                    election will prevent you from voting</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="state-p">Starting April 2020, voters who miss the mail-in ballot request deadline may apply for an
                emergency absentee ballot until close of polls on Election Day if:</p>
            <ul class="list-2">
                <li>They could not apply to vote by mail by the deadline due to disability, illness, or professional

                <li>They become ill or disabled after the deadline and cannot vote in person</li>
                <li>They learn that they will be unable to vote in person due to professional responsibilities, of which
                    they were unaware and could not reasonably be made aware prior to the mail-in ballot request
                    deadline</li>
