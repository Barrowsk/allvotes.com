            <p class="state-p">New Mexico’s registration form requires you to put down your full Social Security
                Number.<br><br>If you are registering to vote for the first time in New Mexico and you submit the
                registration form by mail (not in person at the clerk’s office), you need to include a copy of an ID
                with your registration form OR include a copy of an ID with your absentee ballot OR present the physical
                ID at the polls.<br><br>The acceptable forms of ID include:</p>
            <ul class="list-2">
                <li>An original or copy of a photo identification issued by a government or educational institution</li>

                to match the address on your certificate of registration. Contact your county clerk if you have
                questions.</p>

                copy of one of the above forms of ID will need to present ID before voting. If you do not have a valid
                ID, you may cast a provisional ballot. Your ballot will be counted if you provide a valid ID to the
                county clerk’s office before 5 p.m. on the second day following the election. Some municipal
                jurisdictions have a voter identification requirement. Be sure to check your jurisdiction’s requirements
                before Election Day.</p>
