            <h3 class="heading-3">To Register</h3>
            <p class="state-p">Arizona’s voter registration form asks for your Arizona driver’s license or state ID
                number, or the last four digits of your Social Security number. Make sure to provide this information on
                the registration form.<br><br>While all voters need to show ID at the polls (see
                below), first-time voters in the state who register by mail will need to submit a copy of identification
                with an early ballot if they failed to provide this information on the registration form.<br><br>Arizona
                also has a proof of citizenship requirement for registering to vote in state and local elections.
                Providing an Arizona driver’s license or state ID number issued after October 1, 1996, on either the
                state or federal voter registration form, fulfills the proof of citizenship requirement. You don’t need
                to provide anything more. If you don’t have an Arizona driver’s license or state ID issued after October
                1, 1996, you will be registered for federal elections either way but you will need to provide proof of
                citizenship in order to vote in state and local elections.<br><br>Proof of citizenship includes any one
                of the items on the list below. If you fail to provide that and the election official is not able to
                match you with an existing motor vehicles record showing you proved your citizenship, you will only be
                able to receive a federal ballot and will not be able to vote in state and local elections. </p>
            <ul class="list-2">
                <li>A photocopy of a U.S. birth certificate and supporting legal documentation (i.e. marriage
                    certificate) if your name has changed</li>
                <li>A photocopy of the front pages of your passport</li>
                <li>Naturalization documents or your Alien Registration Number</li>
                <li>Indian Census Number, Bureau of Indian Affairs Card Number, Tribal Treaty Card Number, or Tribal
                    Enrollment Number</li>

            </ul>
            <h3 class="heading-3">To Vote</h3>
            <p class="state-p">All voters must present ID at the polls. Voters have several options: they can present
                one form of ID which bears the name, address, and photo of the voter (List 1); two forms of non–photo ID
                which bear the name and address of the voter (List 2); a List 1 photo ID with a non–matching address
                plus a List 2 non-photo ID with a matching address; or a U.S. passport or military ID without any
                address plus a List 2 non–photo ID with a matching address</p>
            <ul class="list-2">
                <li>List 1: Acceptable forms of photo ID include: an Arizona driver’s license or identification card;
                    tribal identification or enrollment card; or other valid U.S. federal, state, or local
                    government–issued identification.</li>
                <li>List 2: Acceptable forms of non–photo ID include: a voter registration card; a utility (including
                    cell phone) bill; bank or credit union statement; Arizona vehicle registration; Arizona vehicle
                    insurance card; Indian census card; property tax statement; county recorder’s certificate; tribal
                    enrollment card or other form of tribal ID; other valid U.S. federal, state, or local
                    government–issued identification; and any mail addressed to the voter marked “Official Election
                    Material.” Utility bills must be dated within 90 days of the election to be valid. College or
                    university IDs that lack addresses cannot be used as voter ID, even if the voter has a separate
                    document that shows their address.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="heading-2" id="vote">How can I vote?</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <h3 class="heading-3">By Mail</h3>
            <p class="state-p">Voters do not need an excuse to vote early by mail in Arizona. Voters wishing to vote
                early by mail ballot can request this ballot from their local County Recorder. The early ballot request
                form must be received by the County Recorder by the 11th day before Election Day. After you vote, you
                must mail your early ballot so that it is received by the County Recorder or drop it off at any polling
                place in the voter’s county of residence by no later than 7 p.m. on Election Day.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-3">Early In-Person</h3>
            <p class="state-p">A voter may request and cast or simply cast an early voting ballot at any early voting
                location site between 27 days before Election Day and the Friday before Election Day. If you requested
                an early ballot, you are not required to cast that ballot—you can still vote in person, so long as you
                only vote once.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-3">On Election Day</h3>
            <p class="state-p">Voting sites will be open from 6 a.m. until 7 p.m. on Election Day. If you are in line by
                the closing time then you must be allowed to vote. You can find more information about your voting site
