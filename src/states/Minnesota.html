                and address, when you register or the first time you vote.<br><br>If you choose to register on Election

                You have a couple options. These include:</p>

                <li>Showing an ID with current name and address such as a valid Minnesota driver's license, learners
                    permit or ID, or a tribal ID with name, address, photo and signature</li>
                <li>Showing a Photo ID, even an expired one, and a different document with your current name and address
                    including a bill, account or start-of-service statement due or dated within 30 days of the election
                    for any utility, residential lease or rent agreement valid through Election Day, or current student

                <li>Having a registered voter from your precinct vouch for you and confirm your address by signing an
                    oath (Note: A registered voter can vouch for up to eight voters. You cannot vouch for others if
                    someone vouched for you)</li>
                <li>Showing college student ID if your college has provided a student housing list</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="state-p"><br>Finally, if you registered to vote within 20 days of the election, you may get a
                Notice
                of Late Registration in the mail. If you do not appear on the rolls, you can use that as your proof of
                residence to register.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-3">To Vote</h3>
            <p class="state-p">Minnesota voters with current and active registrations do not need to show ID before
                voting.</p>
            <h2 class="heading-2" id="vote">How can I vote?</h2>
            <div class="divider"></div>
            <h3 class="heading-3">By Mail</h3>
            <p class="state-p">You may request an absentee ballot through either a paper application or an online
                application. If you apply for an absentee ballot online, you must provide an email address and a
                Minnesota-issued driver’s license/ID card number or the last four digits of your Social Security
                number.<br><br>Absentee ballot applications must be submitted online or received by your local election
                office by the day before Election Day. You must fill out your absentee ballot in front of another
                registered Minnesota voter or a notary and submit your absentee ballot either by mailing it or by
                hand-delivering it to your local elections office.<br><br>If you are submitting your ballot by mail, it
                must be received by your local elections office before polls close on Election Day. If you hand-deliver
                your absentee ballot, it must be received by your local elections office by no later than 3 p.m. on
                Election Day. You may register to vote at the same time as you vote by absentee ballot, so long as you
                include a registration form and have shown your proof of address to the person who witnesses your
                ballot.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-3">Early In-Person</h3>
            <p class="state-p">All Minnesota voters may vote “absentee” in person beginning 46 days before Election Day.
                Unregistered voters may register by bringing proof of address with them to their early voting location.
                County elections offices serve as early voting locations during their normal business hours. Cities and
                towns may provide additional early voting locations as well. All early voting locations are open the
                last Saturday before Election Day and the day before Election Day. For more information on early voting
                locations and hours, contact your county election office or city clerk’s office.</p>

                the closing time then you must be allowed to vote. You can find information about your voting site and
