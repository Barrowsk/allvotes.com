            <h3 class="heading-3">To Register</h3>
            <p class="state-p">Tennessee’s voter registration form asks for your full 9-digit Social Security
                Number.<br><br>If you are registering to vote for the first time in Tennessee and you submit the
                registration form by mail (not in person at the county election commission office), you will need to
                submit a copy of one of the following forms of ID with your registration form or present the physical ID
                at the polls.<br><br>Acceptable forms of ID for first-time mail-in registrants include:</p>
            <ul class="list-2">
                <li>A current photo I.D. with the voter's name and photo (with or without an address</li>
                <li>A current utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck or other government document that
                    shows the voter’s name and address</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="state-p">Some forms of ID may simultaneously satisfy this requirement as well as the photo ID
                requirement below, like a current Tennessee driver’s license, but an expired photo ID will NOT satisfy
                the first-time mail-in registrant requirement.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-3">To Vote</h3>
            <p class="state-p">Voters must show a government-issued photo ID when voting in person at the polls either
                early or on Election Day. If you’re casting an absentee ballot in Tennessee, you do NOT have to provide
                a copy of your photo ID. If this is your first time voting since registering in Tennessee, you must vote
                in person.<br><br>Acceptable forms of ID include:</p>
            <ul class="list-2">
                <li>Current or expired Tennessee driver license with a photo</li>
                <li>Current or expired U.S. passport</li>
                <li>Current or expired free photo I.D. issued by the Tennessee Department of Safety & Homeland Security
                </li>
                <li>Current or expired photo I.D. issued by the federal or Tennessee state government</li>
                <li>Current or expired employee I.D. cards issued by the federal or Tennessee state government,
                    including retired state government employee photo I.D. cards and I.D.s issued by public universities
                    to faculty and employees</li>
                <li>Current or expired U.S. military photo I.D.</li>
                <li>Current or expired Tennessee gun permit card with photo</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="state-p">Student IDs, even those from public colleges, are NOT acceptable forms of ID.<br><br>If
                you do not have a qualifying photo ID, you will be allowed to cast a provisional ballot. But you will
                then have to provide a qualifying photo ID to election officials within two business days for your vote
                to be counted.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-3">By Mail</h3>
            <p class="state-p">Voters may cast an absentee ballot by mail in Tennessee only if they register to vote in
                person or have voted before in Tennessee.<br><br>If you’re a student, you must be attending school
                outside of your county of registration or have another reason for being outside of your county of
                registration during the early voting period and Election Day to be eligible to vote absentee by
                mail.<br><br><a
                    href="https://sos-tn-gov-files.s3.amazonaws.com/forms/Request_for_Absentee_Ballot.pdf">Applications
                    for absentee ballots</a> must be mailed, emailed or faxed to your county election commission office
                so that they are received by 7 days before Election Day. An absentee ballot must be returned by mail so
                that your county election commission receives it by the closing of the polls on Election Day. You cannot
                hand deliver it.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-3">Early In-Person</h3>
            <p class="state-p">Early in person voting is usually available starting 20 days before an election and ends
                5 days before an election.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-3">On Election day</h3>
            <p class="state-p">Voting sites will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Election Day. If you are in line by
                the closing time then you must be allowed to vote. You can find information about your voting site and
