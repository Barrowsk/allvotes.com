                    <h3 class="heading-4">What is voter suppression?</h3>
                    <p class="disc">Voter suppression is a strategy used to influence the outcome of an election by discouraging or preventing specific groups of people from voting. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, southern states passed Jim Crow laws to suppress poor and racial minority voters. These laws included poll taxes, literacy tests, and grandfather clauses. Today voter suppression takes the form of identification laws, closed polling places and longer lines in minority communities, the intentional spread of misinformation about where and when to vote, gerrymandering of congressional districts, etc.</p>

                    <h3 class="heading-4">Why is voter suppression still around?</h3>
                    <p class="disc">The 1965 Voting Rights Act was meant to protect every citizenâ€™s right to vote. It prohibits racial discrimination through many key protections. Not the least of which, requires that states with a history of voter discrimination must have all bills regarding voting reviewed by the Department of Justice before being signed into law.</p>
                    <p class="disc">The 2013 Supreme Court Case, Shelby County v. Holder, eviscerated the Voting Rights Act. The court repealed the section defining which states had a history of discrimination under the guise that the formula used to determine discrimination was outdated and jeopardized the constitutional principles of federalism and state sovereignty. Without a definition of history of discrimination, the portion subjecting jurisdictions to pre-clearance became obsolete. This opened the door to voter suppression laws as they no longer required vetting. That same year 13 states passed discriminatory voting laws.</p>
                    <h4 class="heading-4">What can you do?</h4>
                    <p class="disc">The best way to ensure that your vote will count on election day is to vote early and come prepared. Check out your state voting guide to find election dates and deadlines and what identification your state requires to register or vote. It also has information about absentee ballots or early voting, both of which are great ways to ensure you will get to vote. Register early, vote early!</p>
